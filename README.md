This Obsidian Plugin allows users to have a different file explorer experience.
Please watch the sample record to see the details.

### Features: 

 - The plugin lists all files including the `files under sub-folders`.
 - Folders and files are in `separate views`.
 - The plugin remembers `last expanded folders` state to load for the following session.
 - The plugin allows you to `Pin` your favorite files to the top. They are saved for the following sessions.
 - You can use `ribbon icon` to activate the `File Tree Leaf` in case you close by mistake. You can turn off `ribbon icon` from the plugin settings.

 **Note**: The last state of `expanded folders` and `pinned files` are saved in `data.json`. Please ensure that you don't delete them manually from `plugin settings` since it will delete all your configuration.
